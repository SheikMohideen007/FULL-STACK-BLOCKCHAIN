3. What is a lexical scope and how is it related to closure?

Ans: lexical scope defines the scope of variable from the OuterFunction. Closure function is a function
     which is enclosed in the OuterFunction and it has a lexical scope to access the variable.
     so, we can access the variable of the OuterFunction inside in the closure function (which is enclosed).
